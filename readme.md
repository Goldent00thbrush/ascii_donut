# ASCII Donut
Animated ascii rotating donut built in c++. 

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to dive deeper into the mathematics of 3D perspective rendering and simple c++ gui. The idea is building a simple ascii donut and display it in form of a qt app with the donut as a class. The UI is a text label that updates every 20 msec.   
## The App

## Technologies 
-	c++
-   qt
## Setup
-	Download all .cpp and .h files.
-	run main.cpp.  
## Features/Components 
-	Simple UI built using qt
-	donut class
## Status 
The project is done. It took around 12 hours to develop and understand the math behind (6 hours per week for 2 weeks).
## Future development
If the development of this project picks up again, here are things I want to work on or improve:
-	Simplification of the math calculations. 
-   Faster method to print the ascii. 
-	Explore the luminosity of other character sets.  
## Acknowledgments 
-	The idea was adopted from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqXNfs_HhY  
-	A lot of the math was explained here https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html
